     <p id="TOP10LINEDESC"> Jared Diamond convincingly argues that geographical and environmental factors shaped the modern world Societies that had had a head start in food production advanced beyond the hunter-gatherer stage, and then developed religion - as well as nasty germs and potent weapons of war - and adventured on sea and land to conquer and decimate preliterate cultures.</p>

     <h2> The History of the Ancient World </h2>
    <img id="GOTLOGO" src="./img/geschiedenisboek4.png" alt="logo">
     <p id="TOP10LINEDESC"> A lively and engaging narrative history showing the common threads in the cultures that gave birth to our own. Dozens of maps provide a clear geography of great events, while timelines give the reader an ongoing sense of the passage of years and cultural interconnection. Literature, epic traditions, private letters and accounts connect kings and leaders with the lives of those they ruled. </p>

     <h2> Democracy: A Life </h2>
     <img id="GOTLOGO" src="./img/geschiedenisboek2.png" alt="logo">
     <p id="TOP10LINEDESC">Ancient Greece first coined the concept of "democracy", yet almost every major ancient Greek thinker-from Plato and Aristotle onwards was ambivalent towards or even hostile to democracy in any form. The explanation for this is quite simple: the elite perceived majority power as tantamount to a dictatorship of the proletariat. Cartledge sheds light on the variety of democratic practices in the classical world as well as on their similarities to and dissimilarities from modern democratic forms, from the American and French revolutions to contemporary political thought.</p>

     <h2> Churchill: Walking with Destiny </h2>
     <img id="GOTLOGO" src="./img/geschiedenisboek5.png" alt="logo">
     <p id="TOP10LINEDESC"> We think of Churchill as a hero who saved civilization from the evils of Nazism and warned of the grave crimes of Soviet communism, but Roberts's masterwork reveals that he has as much to teach us about the challenges leaders face today - and the fundamental values of courage, tenacity, leadership and moral conviction. </p>

     <h2> Appeasement </h2>
     <img id="GOTLOGO" src="./img/geschiedenisboek3.jpg" alt="logo">
     <p id="TOP10LINEDESC"> Appeasement is a groundbreaking history of the disastrous years of indecision, failed diplomacy and parliamentary infighting that enabled Hitler's domination of Europe. Drawing on deep archival research and sources not previously seen by historians, Tim Bouverie has created an unforgettable portrait of the ministers, aristocrats, and amateur diplomats who, through their actions and inaction, shaped their country's policy and determined the fate of Europe.
