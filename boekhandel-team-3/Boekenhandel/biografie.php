    <h2>  Alexander Hamilton </h2> 
    <img id="GOTLOGO" src="./img/bioboek1.png" alt="logo">
     <p id="TOP10LINEDESC"> Ron Chernow’s Alexander Hamilton is not only the inspiration for a hit Broadway musical, but also a work of creative genius itself. This massive undertaking of over 800 pages details every knowable moment of the youngest Founding Father’s life: from his role in the Revolutionary War and early American government to his sordid (and ultimately career-destroying) affair with Maria Reynolds. He may never have been president, but he was a fascinating and unique figure in American history — plus it’s fun to get the truth behind the songs.</p>

     <h2>   Napoleon: A Life by Andrew Roberts </h2> 
     <img id="GOTLOGO" src="./img/bioboek2.png" alt="logo">
     <p id="TOP10LINEDESC">Here’s another bio that will reshape your views of a famed historical tyrant, though this time in a surprisingly favorable light. Decorated scholar Andrew Roberts delves into the life of Napoleon Bonaparte, from his near-flawless military instincts to his complex and confusing relationship with his wife. But Roberts’ attitude toward his subject is what really makes this work shine: rather than ridiculing him (as it would undoubtedly be easy to do), he approaches the “petty tyrant” with a healthy amount of deference.</p>

     <h2>  Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson </h2> 
     <img id="GOTLOGO" src="./img/bioboek3.png" alt="logo">
     <p id="TOP10LINEDESC">The man, the myth, the legend: Steve Jobs, co-founder and CEO of Apple, is properly immortalized in Isaacson’s masterful biography. It divulges the details of Jobs’ little-known childhood and tracks his fateful path from garage engineer to leader of one of the largest tech companies in the world — not to mention his formative role in other legendary companies like Pixar and indeed within the Silicon Valley ecosystem as a whole.</p>

     <h2>  Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare by Stephen Greenblatt </h2> 
     <img id="GOTLOGO" src="./img/bioboek4.png" alt="logo">
     <p id="TOP10LINEDESC"> William Shakespeare is a notoriously slippery historical figure — no one really knows when he was born, what he looked like, or how many plays he wrote. But that didn’t stop Stephen Greenblatt, who in 2004 turned out this magnificently detailed biography of the Bard: a series of imaginative reenactments of his writing process,<br> and insights on how the social and political ideals of the time would have influenced him. Indeed, no one exists in a vacuum, not even Shakespeare —<br> hence the conscious depiction of him in this book as a “will in the world,” rather than an isolated writer shut up in his own musty study. </p>

     <h2>  A Beautiful Mind by Sylvia Nasar </h2> 
      <img id="GOTLOGO" src="./img/bioboek5.png" alt="logo">
     <p id="TOP10LINEDESC"> This biography of esteemed mathematician John Nash was both a finalist for the 1998 Pulitzer Prize and the basis for the award-winning film of the same name. Nasar thoroughly explores Nash’s prestigious career, from his beginnings at MIT to his work at the RAND Corporation —<br> as well the internal battle he waged against schizophrenia, a disorder that nearly derailed his life.
